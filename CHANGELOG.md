# Aetheri Changelog

All notable changes to the Aetheri High-Fidelity Dual-Channel Mastering EQ plugin will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [v00.14] - 2024-12-24

### Added
- **Latency Reporting**: Plugin now reports oversampling latency to host for proper delay compensation
- **Bypass Parameter**: Full bypass functionality with UI toggle button
- **Multi-Platform CI**: GitHub Actions workflow builds for Windows, macOS (Universal), and Linux
- **Universal VST3 Bundle**: CI assembles cross-platform VST3 bundle with all platform binaries

### Fixed
- **Preset Loading**: Fixed race condition where timer would reset ComboBox selection before onChange fired
- **Preset Atomicity**: Added `isLoadingPreset` flag to prevent channel linking interference during preset load
- **State Sync**: Factory presets now force atomic state update via replaceState after applying
