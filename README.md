# Knobula
PLUGIN NAME: Knobula (Mastering EQ)
CONCEPT: A musical, dual-channel mastering EQ based on passive filter topologies and analog hysteresis, themed as a cosmic control center (Knob + Nebula).

I. CORE SPECIFICATIONS
- Format: VST3, AU, (AAX planned)
- Processing: 64-bit internal (Mastering Grade).
- Channels: True Stereo/Dual Mono architecture with Mid/Side switch.
- Use: Final-stage tonal shaping and adding analog character.

II. MARKETING USPs
- Primary USP: Passive Parallel Topology (4 musical, broad-Q bands designed for smooth tonal shaping, featuring separate Main Gain and Fine Trim controls).
- Secondary USP: Analog Hysteresis Stage (Dual-control modeling with separate knobs for Tube Harmonics and Transformer Saturation).

III. FUNCTIONALITY
- Bands: 4 fully parametric bands (LF, LMF, HMF, HF). Q values are broad/musical.
- Gain Trim: Each of the 4 bands gets a dedicated ±1dB Fine Trim knob.
- Hysteresis Stage: Two separate controls: Tube Harmonics and Transformer Saturate. Switch to engage/bypass.
- Global Controls: Input Gain, Output Trim, HPF, LPF, Stereo Link/Mid/Side Switch.

IV. UI NOTES (NEBULA VISUALIZER INTEGRATION)
- Aesthetic: Vintage analog hardware, dark panel, with a subtle "tube glow" effect when Hysteresis is engaged.
- Background Visualizer: The main background or central display area will function as a **Nebula Visualizer**.
    - **Visual Function:** Subtle, slow-moving 'stars' or particles in the background will represent frequency energy.
    - **Band Correlation:** The color of the stars will be tied to the 4 EQ bands (e.g., LF=Blue, LMF=Green, HMF=Yellow, HF=Red), with the intensity/density of the stars reacting dynamically to the energy level of their corresponding frequency band.
- Metering: Large, slow-moving VU meters for input/output (RMS).
- Focus: Large knobs for main functions, smaller distinct dials for Fine Trim and Hysteresis.
